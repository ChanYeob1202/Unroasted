Two months into running One:scape coffee, and I'm barely touching the espresso machine – here's what's really happening on the ground

When I started managing One:scape coffee two months ago, I thought I knew what I was getting into. LA loves its coffee, right? We invested in quality equipment, curated a solid traditional coffee menu, and prepared for the usual rush of espresso-based drinks. What I didn't expect was to witness firsthand the most dramatic shift in café culture I've ever seen.

## The Reality That Hit Me on Day One

I barely use the espresso machine during the day. Let that sink in for a moment. We're a coffee shop, and our primary coffee equipment sits mostly idle while I'm constantly whisking matcha and steaming milk for matcha lattes.

But here's what's even more interesting than the ordering patterns – it's the conversations happening at the tables. Customers aren't just ordering matcha and leaving. They're gathering around, comparing notes about their experiences at other LA matcha spots. I hear constant discussions about Stagger and Rok – the two places everyone considers the top matcha destinations in LA – and how our matcha stacks up.

It's become this whole subculture. People are genuinely passionate about it, treating matcha exploration like wine tasting or craft beer appreciation. They're not just drinking it; they're studying it, comparing it, and building community around it.

## What I'm Actually Hearing at the Tables

The conversations I overhear daily would surprise anyone who thinks matcha is just another trendy drink. Customers come in talking about their morning matcha at Rok, then want to try ours for comparison. They discuss the texture differences, the preparation styles, the sourcing. Some have become regulars not because they love our matcha specifically, but because they're on this mission to try every matcha offering in LA.

Last week, I watched a group of four people spend over an hour at one table, each having ordered different matcha preparations, passing cups around for everyone to taste. They were taking notes. Actual notes. About matcha. At a coffee shop.

One regular told me she's been to twelve different matcha spots in LA this month alone. Another customer said he drives from Santa Monica to try different matcha places across the city, treating it like a hobby. This level of engagement is something I've never seen with coffee, even among serious coffee enthusiasts.

## The Stagger and Rok Effect

What's fascinating is how Stagger and Rok have become the benchmarks. Almost daily, someone asks me how our matcha compares to theirs. These aren't just casual mentions – people are legitimately comparing preparation techniques, flavor profiles, and overall experiences. It's created this competitive landscape where every new café offering matcha is measured against these established spots.

The fact that these two places have built such strong reputations specifically around matcha tells you everything about where LA's café culture is heading. They've proven that you can build a successful business primarily around this one product, and now everyone else is trying to figure out how to compete or complement what they're doing.

## The Business Reality I Wasn't Prepared For

From a business perspective, this shift has been both surprising and educational. Our coffee sales are disappointingly low, but our matcha sales are through the roof. I'm ordering matcha powder more frequently than coffee beans. Our milk consumption has actually increased because so many people want matcha lattes rather than straight matcha tea.

The profit margins are interesting too. Matcha costs more than coffee per serving, but customers are willing to pay premium prices without question. A $6 matcha latte doesn't make anyone blink, while that same price for coffee might get some pushback.

What's really changed my perspective is seeing how matcha has created a different type of café experience. Coffee culture, especially in LA, can be very individual – people grab their drink and go. But matcha seems to encourage lingering, discussion, and social interaction. My tables stay occupied longer, but customers are also more engaged and likely to become regulars.

## The Social Media Reality

Every day, I watch customers photograph their matcha drinks. Not just a quick snap, but carefully staged photos with different angles, lighting adjustments, and multiple shots. The bright green color is undeniably photogenic, but it goes beyond that. People are documenting their matcha journey across different LA spots.

I see customers posting stories comparing our matcha to what they had at other places earlier that day. They're creating content around their matcha experiences in a way I've never seen with coffee. It's become part of their personal brand and social media presence.

## What This Means for Someone in the Industry

Managing One:scape during this cultural shift has given me a front-row seat to something bigger than just a beverage trend. This feels like a fundamental change in what people want from their café experience. They want discovery, education, and community – not just caffeine.

The competition landscape has completely changed. We're not just competing with other coffee shops anymore; we're competing with specialized matcha places like Stagger and Rok. Success now means understanding matcha sourcing, preparation techniques, and being able to educate customers about what makes each offering unique.

## The Future I'm Seeing

Based on what I'm witnessing daily at One:scape, this trend isn't slowing down. If anything, it's intensifying. New customers discover matcha through social media, come in to try it, and become part of this growing community of matcha enthusiasts exploring LA's offerings.

The market is clearly supporting multiple successful matcha-focused businesses, and there's room for more. But success requires understanding that customers aren't just buying a drink – they're buying into an experience, a community, and a lifestyle.

The biggest lesson from these first two months? Sometimes the market tells you what business you're really in, regardless of what you thought you were opening. We opened a coffee shop, but we're really running a matcha experience center that happens to serve coffee on the side.

## What I Wish I'd Known Before Opening

If I were starting over, I'd invest much more heavily in matcha equipment, sourcing, and staff training. I'd study what makes Stagger and Rok successful beyond just their product quality. I'd plan for longer customer dwell times and design the space to encourage the social interaction that matcha seems to naturally create.

Most importantly, I'd prepare for customers who are genuinely passionate about their matcha experience and want to engage in detailed conversations about preparation, sourcing, and flavor profiles. This isn't casual drink ordering – it's a enthusiast culture that requires real knowledge and engagement to serve properly.

The matcha revolution in LA is real, it's happening right now, and it's completely changing what it means to run a café in this city. As someone living it daily, I can tell you the transformation is more dramatic and more permanent than anyone predicted.
