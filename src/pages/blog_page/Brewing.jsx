        <p className="text-lg mb-6 leading-relaxed">
          In a world of quick-fix coffee solutions and automated machines, there's something almost meditative about the pour-over method. 
          It's a brewing technique that transforms your daily coffee ritual into a moment of mindfulness, connecting you directly with the 
          brewing process in a way that no machine can replicate.

        <h2 className="text-2xl font-semibold mt-8 mb-4">What Makes Pour-Over Special?</h2>
        <p className="mb-6">
          Pour-over coffee is celebrated for its clarity of flavor and ability to highlight the subtle notes in your favorite beans. 
          Unlike immersion methods or espresso, pour-over brewing gives you complete control over every variable - from water temperature 
          to pour speed. This level of control allows you to extract the perfect balance of flavors, resulting in a clean, bright, and 
          nuanced cup of coffee.

        <h2 className="text-2xl font-semibold mt-8 mb-4">The Pour-Over Renaissance</h2>
        <p className="mb-6">
          While pour-over coffee has been around for over a century (thanks to Melitta Bentz's 1908 invention), 
          it's seen a remarkable revival in the third-wave coffee movement. This resurgence isn't just about 
          the brewing method - it's about a return to intentionality in our coffee consumption, a pushback 
          against the rush of modern life.
