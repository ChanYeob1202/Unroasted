              Born from a passion for connecting people across the globe, Unroasted emerged as a response to a simple observation: while coffee brings people together in cafes worldwide, there wasn't a dedicated online space where anyone curious about coffee could truly belong, learn, and grow. We set out to change that.
            </p>
            <p>
              At Unroasted, we believe every cup of coffee tells a story, and everyone—whether you're taking your first sip or have been brewing for decades—has a place at our table. Founded with a simple yet powerful vision, we've created more than just a website – we've built a thriving digital sanctuary where coffee journeys begin, evolve, and flourish.
